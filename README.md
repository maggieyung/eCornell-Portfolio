# 🫧🍏 Overview

Portfolio for my Machine Learning Foundations Course with Break Through Tech AI

## 🌲 Featured ML Project 
[Government Confidence and Corruption Perception ML Model](https://github.com/maggieyung/ecornell-portfolio/blob/main/DefineAndSolveMLProblem.ipynb)
- A supervised regression machine learning model using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, and Sklearn, with the goal of predicting a numerical score for perceptions of corruption and confidence in national government, based on the World Happiness Report (WHR) dataset
- Implemented feature engineering and content-based filtering techniques, benchmarking multiple models; gradient boosting yielded the best performance with RMSE = 0.1129, R2 = 0.6179, and MAE = 0.0803
